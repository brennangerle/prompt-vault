# üîê Firebase Security Fixes - Manual Deployment Guide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

Your Firebase Realtime Database had **critical security vulnerabilities** that have been fixed:
- Any authenticated user could read the entire database
- Any authenticated user could write to the entire database

## üöÄ Quick Deployment (2 minutes)

### Option 1: Command Line (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Authenticate with Firebase (if not already done)
firebase login

# 2. Deploy the fixed security rules
firebase deploy --only database

# 3. Verify deployment succeeded
echo "‚úÖ Security rules deployed successfully!"
```

### Option 2: Firebase Console (Manual)
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select project: **prompt-vault-bw4ot**
3. Navigate to **Realtime Database > Rules**
4. Replace the current rules with the content from `database.rules.json`
5. Click **Publish**

## üîç Verification Steps

After deployment, verify the fixes:

1. **Check Rules are Active**:
   - Go to Firebase Console > Realtime Database > Rules
   - Confirm you see the updated rules with root-level denies

2. **Test Security**:
   - Use the **Rules Playground** in Firebase Console
   - Try accessing `/email-verification` as a regular user (should fail)
   - Try accessing `/users/{userId}` as wrong user (should fail)

## üìã What Was Fixed

### Before (VULNERABLE):
```json
"email-verification": {
  "$emailKey": {
    ".read": "auth != null",        // ‚ùå ANY user could read
    ".write": "auth != null"        // ‚ùå ANY user could write
  }
}
```

### After (SECURE):
```json
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": false,                 // ‚úÖ Default deny
    ".write": false,                // ‚úÖ Default deny
    "email-verification": {
      "$emailKey": {
        ".read": "auth != null && root.child('users').child(auth.uid).child('role').val() == 'super_user'",
        ".write": "auth != null && root.child('users').child(auth.uid).child('role').val() == 'super_user'"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Model Now Enforced

- **Root Level**: Default deny all access
- **Users**: Can only access their own data
- **Teams**: Only team members can read, only super_users can write
- **Prompts**: Access based on sharing settings (private/team/global)
- **Email Verification**: Only super_users can access (was the main vulnerability)

## ‚ö° If You See Errors After Deployment

If your app stops working after deployment:

1. **Check Authentication**: Ensure users are properly authenticated
2. **Verify User Roles**: Make sure super_user roles are set correctly
3. **Test with Firebase Console**: Use the Rules Playground to debug specific access patterns

## üìû Need Help?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the Firebase Console for error messages
2. Use the Rules Playground to test specific scenarios
3. Review the logs in Firebase Console > Realtime Database > Usage

**‚è∞ Deploy these fixes immediately** to secure your database from unauthorized access.
