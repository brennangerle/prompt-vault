# Security Fixes Applied

## Firebase Realtime Database Security Issues - FIXED ✅

### Issues Identified:
- **Critical**: Any logged-in user could read the entire database
- **Critical**: Any logged-in user could write to the entire database
- **Root Cause**: Overly permissive rules in the `email-verification` section

### Fixes Applied:

#### 1. Fixed Email Verification Rules
**Before (VULNERABLE):**
```json
"$emailKey": {
  ".read": "auth != null",
  ".write": "auth != null"
}
```

**After (SECURE):**
```json
"$emailKey": {
  ".read": "auth != null && root.child('users').child(auth.uid).child('role').val() == 'super_user'",
  ".write": "auth != null && root.child('users').child(auth.uid).child('role').val() == 'super_user'"
}
```

#### 2. Added Root-Level Security
**Added default deny rules at the root level:**
```json
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": false,
    ".write": false,
    // ... specific rules follow
  }
}
```

### Security Model Summary:
- **Users**: Can only access their own data or super_users can access any user data
- **Teams**: Only team members can read team data, only super_users can write
- **Prompts**: Access based on sharing settings (private/team/global) and ownership
- **Email Verification**: Only super_users can access (was the main vulnerability)

### Deployment Instructions:
1. Run: `firebase login` (if not already authenticated)
2. Run: `firebase deploy --only database`
3. Verify in Firebase Console that rules are active

### Verification Steps:
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select project: `prompt-vault-bw4ot`
3. Navigate to **Realtime Database > Rules**
4. Confirm the updated rules are deployed
5. Use the **Rules Playground** to test different scenarios

### Test Cases to Verify:
- ❌ Unauthenticated users cannot read/write anything
- ❌ Regular users cannot access email-verification data
- ✅ Users can access their own user data
- ✅ Team members can read team data they belong to
- ✅ Prompt sharing works according to privacy settings
- ✅ Super users can access all data (admin functionality)

## Previous Security Measures (Already in Place):

## Security Principles Applied

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users only have access to data they need
2. **Role-Based Access Control**: Different permissions for regular users vs super users
3. **Data Validation**: Ensures data integrity with validation rules
4. **Authenticated Access Only**: No public read/write access
5. **Granular Permissions**: Specific rules for each data path

## Testing Recommendations

After deployment, test the following scenarios:

1. **User Data Access**: Verify users can only access their own profile
2. **Team Access**: Confirm users can only see teams they're members of
3. **Prompt Sharing**: Test private, team, and global prompt visibility
4. **Admin Functions**: Verify super user privileges work correctly
5. **Unauthorized Access**: Confirm denied access returns proper errors

## Files Modified

- `database.rules.json`: Updated with secure rules

The security rules are now ready for deployment and will protect your database from unauthorized access while maintaining the application's functionality.
