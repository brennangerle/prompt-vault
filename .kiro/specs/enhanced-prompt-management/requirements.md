# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the prompt management capabilities in the super user view, providing comprehensive controls for managing prompts across the platform. Super users will be able to remove, edit, and tag prompts, as well as manage custom prompts on a per-team basis through an improved team selection interface.

## Requirements

2. WHEN a super user clicks edit on a prompt THEN the system SHALL open an editable form with all prompt fields
3. WHEN a super user clicks delete on a prompt THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog before removing the prompt
4. WHEN a super user saves prompt changes THEN the system SHALL validate the data and update the prompt in the database
5. IF a prompt deletion would affect active team configurations THEN the system SHALL warn the user before proceeding

### Requirement 2

5. WHEN a super user searches or filters prompts THEN the system SHALL include tag-based filtering options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a super user, I want to manage custom prompts on a per-team basis, so that I can control which prompts are available to specific teams.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a super user accesses team prompt management THEN the system SHALL display a team selector at the top of the interface
2. WHEN a super user selects a team THEN the system SHALL show prompts specific to that team
3. WHEN a super user assigns a prompt to a team THEN the system SHALL update the team's prompt configuration
4. WHEN a super user removes a prompt from a team THEN the system SHALL update the team configuration and confirm the action
5. IF a prompt is assigned to multiple teams THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate this in the interface

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a super user, I want an improved interface for prompt management, so that I can efficiently navigate and manage large numbers of prompts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a super user accesses the prompt management interface THEN the system SHALL provide search and filtering capabilities
2. WHEN a super user views the prompt list THEN the system SHALL display prompts in a paginated, sortable table
3. WHEN a super user performs bulk operations THEN the system SHALL provide multi-select functionality
4. WHEN a super user switches between global and team-specific views THEN the system SHALL maintain context and filters
5. WHEN the interface loads THEN the system SHALL display loading states and handle errors gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a super user, I want to see prompt usage analytics, so that I can make informed decisions about prompt management and team assignments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a super user views a prompt THEN the system SHALL display usage statistics including frequency and last used date
2. WHEN a super user views team prompt assignments THEN the system SHALL show which teams are using each prompt
3. WHEN a super user considers deleting a prompt THEN the system SHALL show impact analysis of teams and users affected
4. WHEN a super user views prompt analytics THEN the system SHALL provide filtering by date range and team
5. IF a prompt has no recent usage THEN the system SHALL highlight it as potentially unused

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a super user, I want to import and export prompt configurations, so that I can backup, migrate, or share prompt setups between environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a super user initiates a prompt export THEN the system SHALL generate a downloadable configuration file
2. WHEN a super user imports a prompt configuration THEN the system SHALL validate the format and preview changes
3. WHEN importing prompts THEN the system SHALL handle conflicts with existing prompts gracefully
