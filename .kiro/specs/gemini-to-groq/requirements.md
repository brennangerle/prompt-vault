# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves changing the LLM model from Google's Gemini to GROQ in the application. The change is intended for a testing phase to evaluate GROQ's performance and capabilities compared to the currently used Gemini model. This transition requires updating the AI integration code, dependencies, and ensuring all existing functionality continues to work with the new model provider.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: GROQ Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate GROQ as the LLM provider instead of Gemini, so that I can test and evaluate its performance for the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application makes AI requests THEN the system SHALL route them to GROQ instead of Gemini.
2. WHEN installing the application THEN the system SHALL include all necessary GROQ dependencies.
3. WHEN configuring the application THEN the system SHALL support GROQ API keys and configuration.
4. WHEN the application is running THEN the system SHALL maintain the same API interface for AI requests as before.

### Requirement 2: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper configuration management for the GROQ integration, so that I can easily switch between models or providers if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the environment THEN the system SHALL support environment variables for GROQ API keys.
2. WHEN deploying the application THEN the system SHALL have clear documentation on how to configure GROQ.
3. IF the GROQ API key is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages.

### Requirement 3: Feature Parity

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing AI features to continue working with GROQ, so that I don't experience any regression in functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the prompt optimization feature THEN the system SHALL maintain the same functionality with GROQ.
2. WHEN generating prompt metadata THEN the system SHALL produce equivalent results with GROQ as with Gemini.
3. WHEN making any AI request THEN the system SHALL handle responses from GROQ in the same format as it did with Gemini.

### Requirement 4: Performance Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to monitor the performance of GROQ compared to Gemini, so that I can make informed decisions about which provider to use long-term.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making AI requests THEN the system SHALL log response times and other relevant metrics.
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL capture and log detailed error information for debugging.

### Requirement 5: Fallback Mechanism

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an easy way to switch back to Gemini if needed, so that I can quickly resolve any issues that might arise with GROQ.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the application THEN the system SHALL support a configuration option to switch between GROQ and Gemini.
2. IF critical errors occur with GROQ THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions on how to revert to Gemini.
