# First-Time Login Fix for Super User/Master Keeper

## Problem
When the master keeper (super user) tried to log in for the first time using their email `masterprompter@admin.com`, the application showed "User Not Found" even though they were defined as a super user in the system.

## Root Cause
The first-time login page uses the `verifyEmailExists()` function which only checks the `email-verification` table in Firebase Database. The super user email was hardcoded in the authentication system but had no corresponding entry in the email verification table.

## Solution Summary
I implemented the following fixes:

### 1. Modified `verifyEmailExists()` function in `src/lib/db.ts`
- Added a special check for the super user email `masterprompter@admin.com`
- Returns appropriate verification data for the super user without requiring a database entry

```typescript
// Check if it's the super user account first
if (email === 'masterprompter@admin.com') {
  return {
    exists: true,
    userId: 'super_user',
    email: email,
    teamId: undefined // Super user doesn't belong to a specific team
  };
}
```

### 2. Updated authentication logic in `src/lib/auth.ts`
- Removed hardcoded password dependency for super user
- Modified super user login to accept any password set during first-time login
- Added proper error messages directing users to first-time login when appropriate

### 3. Enhanced first-time login UI in `src/app/first-time-login/page.tsx`
- Added special display for super user status
- Shows "Role: Super User" instead of team information for the master keeper

### 4. Cleaned up unused code
- Removed hardcoded password from `superUserAccount` object
- Removed password validation logic that was preventing flexible password setup

## How It Works Now

1. **First-Time Login Flow for Super User:**
   - User enters `masterprompter@admin.com` on first-time login page
   - `verifyEmailExists()` recognizes the super user email and returns success
   - User can set their own password
   - Firebase Auth account is created with the chosen password
   - User database entry is created/updated with super_user role

2. **Regular Login Flow for Super User:**
   - User enters email and password on regular login page
   - System checks Firebase Auth with provided password (not hardcoded)
   - If successful, user is logged in as super user
   - If no Firebase Auth account exists, user is directed to first-time login

## Testing
- The code compiles successfully (verified with `npm run build`)
- Authentication logic handles both first-time and returning super user scenarios
- UI properly displays super user status during first-time setup

## Files Modified
1. `src/lib/db.ts` - Updated `verifyEmailExists()` function
2. `src/lib/auth.ts` - Modified super user authentication logic
3. `src/app/first-time-login/page.tsx` - Enhanced UI for super user display

The master keeper can now successfully complete first-time login and set their own password.
